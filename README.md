## Interests & Advocacy
I focus on rigorous engineering practices including Test-Driven Development (TDD), clean code, low-level programming (C/C++), and competitive programming, while pursuing lifelong learning in physics, mathematics, and computer science. I am an active advocate for open education, mental health, sustainability, and children's rights (safety, health, education), which includes supporting climate action, eco-sustainability, and animal rights (supporting both cats and dogs equally, a paradox embraced). As a neurodivergent advocate, I prefer text-based asynchronous communication. For personal balance, I enjoy hiking, meditation, running, gym, and sports, am an esports and gaming enthusiast, and seek quiet, nature-based environments. I am a systems-thinking enthusiast who appreciates ergonomic, aesthetic, and cozy setups, and a collector of aphorisms, always looking to connect with like-minded individuals.
